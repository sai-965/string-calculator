# üß∞ Simple TypeScript Starter | 2024

> Steps:
> Create a simple String calculator with a method signature like this:

int add(string numbers)
Input: a string of comma-separated numbers
Output: an integer, sum of the numbers
Examples:

Input: ‚Äú‚Äù, Output: 0
Input: ‚Äú1‚Äù, Output: 1
Input: ‚Äú1,5‚Äù, Output: 6
Allow the add method to handle any amount of numbers.

Allow the add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas). ("1\n2,3" should return 6)

Support different delimiters:

To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers‚Ä¶]". For example, "//;\n1;2" where the delimiter is ";" should return 3.
Calling add with a negative number will throw an exception: "negative numbers not allowed <negative_number>".

If there are multiple negative numbers, show all of them in the exception message, separated by commas.
